# Security Notice

## Changes Made for Public Release

This repository has been sanitized for public distribution. The following sensitive information has been removed or secured:

### 🔒 Database Security

1. **Database Credentials**: Moved from hardcoded values to environment variables
   - File: `db_connect.php`
   - Original: Plain text database credentials
   - Changed: Environment variable-based configuration

2. **Test Data Removal**: Removed sensitive test data from SQL dump
   - File: `kpsus.sql` (moved to gitignore)
   - Original: Contained test admin accounts and member data
   - Changed: Created clean structure file `kpsus_structure.sql`

### 🛡️ Authentication Security

1. **Admin Credentials**: Removed hardcoded admin accounts
   - Original SQL contained: `('1234', '1234', '123')`
   - Solution: Manual admin creation with proper password hashing required

2. **Password Storage**: Currently using plain text (⚠️ SECURITY RISK)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Passwords are stored in plain text in current implementation
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Implement `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` functions

### 📁 File Security

1. **Created `.gitignore`**: Prevents sensitive files from being committed
   - Environment files (`.env`)
   - Database dumps (`*.sql`)
   - Upload directories
   - Log files

2. **Environment Configuration**: Added `.env.example` for secure setup

### 🚨 Remaining Security Concerns

The following issues still need to be addressed before production use:

#### Critical Issues:
1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords are stored in plain text
2. **SQL Injection**: Direct SQL queries without prepared statements
3. **File Upload Security**: No validation on uploaded files
4. **Session Security**: Basic session management without security headers

#### Recommended Fixes:

```php
// Example: Proper password hashing
$hashedPassword = password_hash($plainPassword, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);

// Example: Password verification
if (password_verify($plainPassword, $hashedPassword)) {
    // Login successful
}

// Example: Prepared statement
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM admin WHERE adminUsername = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
```

### 📋 Setup Instructions for Users

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update database credentials in `.env`
3. Import `kpsus_structure.sql` to create database tables
4. Manually create admin user with hashed password
5. Implement remaining security fixes before production use

### 🔍 Files Modified

- `db_connect.php` - Environment variable configuration
- `.gitignore` - Added sensitive file patterns
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `kpsus_structure.sql` - Clean database structure
- `README.md` - Comprehensive setup instructions
- `SECURITY_NOTICE.md` - This file

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- The original `kpsus.sql` file contains sensitive test data and should not be shared publicly
- This application requires additional security hardening before production deployment
- Regular security audits and updates are recommended
- Always use HTTPS in production environments
